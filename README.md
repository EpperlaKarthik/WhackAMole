# WhackAMole
COVID-19 has made us be home quarantined for more than a month, people, especially children need some sort of distraction to keep themselves sane. Whack a mole is a multi-player immersive Arcade game which you can play with your friends and family during this quarantine. The game involves quickly and repeatedly hitting the heads of mechanical moles with a mallet as they pop up from holes. The first Whac-A-Mole game began as an arcade game with an air cylinder system to power the moles popping out of the "dirt". We decided to take this game to the web!
We built this game on Unity3d and on top of Photon PUN and GoogleVR SDK. It is a multiplayer game which allows the user to play online with random people or friends and computer as well. The game currently supports ios and android.

Blockchain Technology is revolutionizing the gaming industry. Most of the games that we play are controlled by centralized agencies. Blockchain creates transparency and solves this multifaceted problem by eliminating centralized gaming entities. The best part of Whack-a-Mole is players can earn micro-rewards and these can be utilized in our NFT market place to trade game objects for like skins and characters for various games. Hence your rewards will have a real-world value. The market place is built on React and we integrated Tezos SmartPy smart contracts for market place purchases.
